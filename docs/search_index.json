[["index.html", "Airbnb Research Chapter 1 Introduction", " Airbnb Research Zhiyi Chen and Zhuo Zhuo 2020-12-17 Chapter 1 Introduction Airbnb, Inc. is an online vacation rental marketplace company founded in 2008. It is a platform for hosts to offer their spare residences and spaces for travelers to stay during their vacation. Airbnb is an additional choice besides traditional hotels. Moreover, it cultivates a sharing-economy by allowing property owners to rent out private property. According to the survey on Investopedia: Airbnb’s Impact on the vacation industry, “Airbnb is valued more highly than several individual hotel chains” (Source link: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/112414/airbnb-brings-sharing-economy-hotels.asp). For this project, we decided to focus our research on New York City’s Airbnb data as it is one of the hottest cities for tourism. On the other hand, since Airbnb is facing fierce competition from the hotel industry here, we believe that New York City can be a good case for us to analyze its business success. We will explore the following questions: How do the distribution and occupancy of Airbnb’s properties in the New York Metropolitan area change over the years? What aspects influence the review score of an Airbnb property the most? How does Covid-19 influence Airbnb businesses in New York City? Our goal for this project is not only to answer these questions we made but to conduct in-depth research on Airbnb’s business model. By doing this, we want our audience to be better informed about this unicorn tech company.

More about Inside Airbnb… Airbnb Listings data(about 48000 records) (listings.csv); year_bar.csv Dataset 1 contains 106 variables, with slightly more categorical variables than numeric ones. Dataset 2 contains 6 variables and the most important one for analysis is the detailed comments. Since there are so many records in dataset 2, one issue appears to be that processing all of them would take a huge amount of computing time. Therefore, we need to do random sampling on the entire data. Another issue about our raw data is that there exists missing values in both datasets and including missing values of numeric variables in our analysis and exploration would result in calculation error. Therefore, we have to remove them under necessary conditions. In addition, there exists some listings with zero price which should not be included in our analysis, so we removed those data points. We also get rid of the listings with “availability_365” = 0, which means that these properties are not available now and there is no point for analyzing them. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 The Columns We Chose From Listings.csv 3.2 The year_bar Dataset 3.3 Data manipulation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 The Columns We Chose From Listings.csv After we downloaded the CSV file, we processed it first directly in excel as it is a great way to look for every column we had. We chose to keep: id,host_id,host_since,host_response_rate,host_acceptance_rate, host_listings_count, host_has_profile_pic, host_identity_verified, neighbourhood_group, latitude, longitude, room_type, accommodates, price, availability_30, availability_365, number_of_reviews, last_review, review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication, review_scores_location, review_scores_value, and reviews_per_month as these variables might be meaningful for our further analysis. The brief understanding of the data is that there are 44187 Airbnb properties collected in this dataset and 26 features that we chose can be grouped into three feature groups: property information, host information, review information Property information (10 features): id, host_since, neighbourhood_group, latitude, longitude, room_type, accomodates, price, availability_30, availability_365. Host information (6 features): host_id, host_response_rate, host_acceptance_rate, host_listings_count, host_has_profile_pic, host_identity_verified. Review information (10 features): number_of_review, last_review, review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication, review_scores_location, review_scores_value, review_per_month. 3.2 The year_bar Dataset For the year_bar.csv file, we transform the hosts’ data from the host_since column in order to see how Airbnb’s hosting members grow over the years. We grouped the data by different boroughs then pivot the dataset wider so we have data filtered out for every year since 2008. Let’s see the whole picture of the dataset: ## # A tibble: 13 x 7 ## year Bronx Brooklyn Manhattan Queens Staten_Island Total ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2008 0 15 7 2 0 24 ## 2 2009 1 138 99 14 3 255 ## 3 2010 25 427 320 43 4 819 ## 4 2011 23 1215 895 111 10 2254 ## 5 2012 40 1966 1658 262 20 3946 ## 6 2013 58 2283 2290 352 13 4996 ## 7 2014 108 2771 3001 599 27 6506 ## 8 2015 100 2800 3211 745 33 6889 ## 9 2016 158 2065 2596 758 52 5629 ## 10 2017 187 1299 1489 768 46 3789 ## 11 2018 180 1111 1335 710 45 3381 ## 12 2019 197 1213 2073 768 43 4294 ## 13 2020 72 433 606 265 12 1388 3.3 Data manipulation To conduct further analysis and visualizations, we filtered the price variable into three levels “Expensive”, “Medium”, and “Budget”. We define any property that has a price higher or equal to $160 as an expensive Airbnb listing. The medium price level is from $65 to $159. The budget properties are those cheaper than $65. Meanwhile, we also separated the review_scores_rating variable into three levels, “Excellent”, “Poor”, and “Good”. The definition of an excellent property is that the listing received an overall score rating of 100. We defined the scores from 92 to 99 to be good review scores. Lastly, those properties that received a review rating of less than 92 are poor reviews. We separated three levels of these two variables according to their interquartile ranges. Price: ## 25% 75% ## 65 160 Overall review scores: ## 25% 75% ## 92 100 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We plot a vis_miss heat graph to investigate the missing patterns in variables that involved in following analysis. For missing row patterns, we observe that most of the rows don’t have missing values. For missing column patterns, we find that there are 12 columns having missing values. Variables host_response_rate and host_acceptance_rate have the highest number of missing values, with 52% and 38% of the value missing. We believe the large amount of missing values in these two is normal for this dataset because the hosts will not respond to all the requests and certainly will not accept all customers. According to our analysis, most hosts filter out about half of their requests via these two steps. Therefore, these two variables make sense to have a large number of missings. Moreover, these two variables will not influence our research since we wi not use them in our further analysis. Other 9 variables of last_review, review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication, review_scores_location, review_scores_value, and reviews_per_month all about the same amount of missing values ( around 25%), and they all related to the same attribute “reviews”. Thus, they will not influence our analysis of the relationship among other factors and overall review scores.

Accroding to chart, we have several discoveries shown below. Manhattan and Brooklyn are the main regions where Airbnb’s residences are located, Bronx and Staten Island have a pretty low number of Airbnb properties. Entire home/apt and Private room are the main type of rooms, only Manhattan has the Hotel room as a category. Moreover, as we can see from the geography graph, especially the shape of Manhatten, the map closely resembles a real map of NYC. We interpret this as the success of Airbnb as it illustrates how dense the Airbnb properties are. We can claim that almost every corner in Manhatten has at least one Airbnb listed property since we obviously can see the shape of Central Park and the shape of island. Besides the current status analysis, we are more curious about the development of Airbnb houses in New York within the past years. We plot the number of new hosted Airbnb properties by year to observe the growth. From the graph above, it is very clear to learn some growth pattern of Airbnb in New York City: From 2008 to 2015, the increment number was increasing, especially in Brooklyn and Manhattan. This shows that Airbnb was growing rapidly in these years. From 2016 to 2019, the increment number had a sign to go down but remained stable during 2017-2019. Nevertheless, in 2020, the increment decreased dramatically and even there was no increment number in Staten Island, no doubt which was the consequence of Covid-19. Entire home/apt and private room are the majority of increment. Hotel room began to appear in 2018 but only in Manhattan, the reason we can guess is that some hotels foresighted the potential of Airbnb and put a part of room source on Airbnb to advertise so that they could attract more customers. It can be seen as a phenomenon of Airbnb’s high growth. 5.2 Features Influence Airbnb Properties’ Review Scores It is widely acknowledged that the review score is a remarkable judgment standard for customers, just like the bad comments which host will try their best to avoid. Sometimes even if one house’s price is lower than another one, its lowest score will make customers have a decision to choose a more expensive one. It is necessary for us to find which feature is the one host should pay much attention to for getting a high review score for their listing(s). Overview of Airbnb reviews: From the treemap graph below, we can see that Brooklyn has the most number of reviews (darker color) although Manhattan has the most number of total Airbnb properties listed online (Larger area). We interpret this as properties in Brooklyn are more likely to have budget-friendly pricing. Thus, more tourists choose to stay in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan. It is also worth mentioning that most reviews that we visualize in this research are from Manhattan or Brooklyn as it is shown in the treemap. Next, we want to understand the distribution of review_scores, we find most scores are very high and even the mean score is above 90. However, there are a few small peaks under the mean level. This situation is within our expectation as most customers will give out high score ratings. We selected a few features to visualize the relationship between them and review scores rating respectively. Price is the first one into our consideration: As we can see from the mosaic plot, more expensive properties tend to have slightly more excellent reviews and less poor reviews. However, we do not think the relationship is very significant. Furthermore, we can observe that most listings on Airbnb have reasonable prices(below $160 above $65) and their review scores are all good(from 92-100). We ploted a scatter plot for further statistical analysis. We saw that there is almost no impact on review rating from price since the smooth line is just near a vertical line with high intercept. However, an oberservation is that when price goes up, the number of low rating decreases correspondingly. Secondly, we want to see if the property types of Airbnb listings affect the overall review scores. This mosaic shows that Airbnb’s listings posted online mostly consist of entire home/apt and private room. However, we still cannot observe any significant relationship between these two features. Thirdly, we want to see whether the number of reviews has relationship with review score rating. Here review per month is not our choice since it has no ability to reveal the operation time of Airbnb’s house and will have positive bias for the ones just on service. The trend is the same as previous graph that no clear relationship appears whereas the houses with high number of review definitely receive high ratings. From these observations, when customers is choosing airbnb house in New York City, the ones with high price and high number of review are more likely to be good choice. The difference in room types does not influence too much on customers’ experience. Of course, it is almost within our expectation and imagination, but the only restriction is whether customer can afford the price. Therefore, can we find other feature influencing review rating? For the continuous features, a correlogram is the most straight way to display the relationships. The continous variables we choose are shown below: HOUSE information: price, availability_365 HOST information: host_response_rate, host_acceptance_rate, host_listings_count EVALUATION information: review_scores_rating Unfortunately, all the continuous variables have low correlation values. Then we turn to the discrete variables, namely: neighbourhood_group, host_identity_verified, host_has_profile_pic The first one is neighbourhood_group: From the density graph, we can see the trend are almost the same except the staten island which has little bit lower density on high review score rating. However, it is not enough to say staten island influences score rating since there are less low score rating from boxplot and the uneven sample may be the reason causing the density trend difference. For the host_identity_verified: The density almost overlapped which is the strong evidence to show the low correlation. The huge difference in the density line indicates that whether host has profile pic influence rating. From the graph, we can inform the host of airbnb house to upload profile pic since it will potentially influence your house rating. To answer the question “Which features influence New York’s airbnb houses’ scores most”, houses with high price and high number of review are more likely to contribute to high scores. Moreoever, “host with profile pic” can also be an impact indicator. 5.3 How does the Covid-19 influence airbnb Covid-19 influences a large number of industry this year and how it causes impact on airbnb in New York. First of all, we should find indicators which can reflect the condition under covid-19. Here, we think last review date can be seen as the activity level of airbnb house. If the last review date is close to date today, it can be somhow considered as active status. In order to have more clear visualization, we only extract the data which have last review date after 2015-01-01. The most recent last review date is collected in 2020-10-11. In our expectation, if airbnb is popular or active in New York, the peak should happen 15 days - 1 month ealier than 2020-10-11, that is, 2020-8-11 to 2020-9-11 because reviews are most likely to appear during check-in or just few day after check-out. As we all know, airbnb app system will automatically remind you to fill review after check-out. In the graph, we can see there is a peak at 2020-09-09 which matches our expectation. However, the more important oberservation is that there is a more higher peak around 2020-01-22 and a valley bottom around 2020-05-26. It can be somewhat explained by covid-19 that covid-19 happened and spread throught New York at around early February, but news came to people’s ear first which may caused more people to check out. And with more serious are the situation of covid-19 in New York, much less people checked in airbnb house. Then with time going by, check-in number recovered gradually. Of course, it is our first guess, we want to see the density of last review date from different dimensions. Here neighbourhood group and room type are into our consideration. We can see for neighbourhood group, there are two peaks and one bottom but the level is different. If our first guess is correct, we can say the airbnb in Bronx and Manhattan influenced more since their first peak has higher density. From room type visulization, we find entie home/apt, hotel room and private room have similiar trend as the overall trend, but for shared room, it has no second peak which may delivered a message that shared room still have no trend to recover under covid-19. Moreover, what about the density by room type and neighbourhood group. From the grid graphs, the densities are more like the ones by room type. Especially for each neighbourhood group, last review date density of shared room show the similiar trend. To answer the question that “how does covid-19 influence airbnb in New York”, we can say that Covid-19 made many customers check out at around mid Janurary causing lot of airbnb house idle which lasted for about 3-4 month. However, the situation became better at Aug-Sept for most room types. Shared room are continuing to be more idle. It is reasonable to get this conlcusion since shared room is easir to spread virus. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 What we found… 7.2 Further discussion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 What we found… How was airbnb develop, how does different features influence airbnb, how does the Covid-19 have impact on airbnb. The 3Hows are the main research topic we are concentrated on. We are willing to find patterns from airbnb development and give some proper suggestions. 7.1.1 Airbnb in New York grows fast but almost comes to high saturation. Airbnb was found in 2008, from then on, the number of it in New York is increasing fast. From the chart in the result part, it is clear to see the patterns but the growth rate slowed down in recent years. With our expectation, the growth rate will continue to decrease and unfortunately, the covid-19 is going to cause worse condition. High saturation is only aimed for the whole number of airbnb house in New York, there could be more opportunites for growth space. Entie house/apt and private room are the main types of airbnb, what about increase the proportion of hotel room and shared room. All hotels and Airbnbs are facing the same difficulty situation under Covid-19. Is it possible to create new commercial mode to contribute to the cooperation of them. All in all, taking minority room type into consideration can be a good way for future development. 7.1.2 Host information is important From our analysis between review score and other features, we can see there are few features having high correlation with review scores. However, host_has_profile_pic is highly related to the score, which is beyond our expectation. This observation is likely to deliver the information that customers care more about the security since host_has_profile_pic tells it is a real host and we can search for his/her information online. For hosts, we suggest them to complete personal information which really matters. 7.1.3 Covid-19 is a disaster but hope is still there Covid-19 not only causes much lower increment of airbnb house compared to previous years but also brought about much revenue lost due to large number of check-outs of customers. The situation is really bad whereas some points can be a way to recover a part of damage. shared room is the type influenced most due to covid-19. Could Airbnb create a strategy to reuse the idle shared room, for example, we can use shared room as “family house”. 7.2 Further discussion Airbnb started to be on market on 2020-12-11, the stock price is continuing to go well. We can consider it is a strategy for airbnb to fight with covid-19 and try to find a way out. With time going by, we can have the data during 2021-2022 which will be a good opportunity for us to justify whether this strategy works well. Moreover, the data we found does not contain all features of airbnb, missing features could be one of the reasons why we found very few features related to review scores. If we have more time, we could webscrape by ourselves to obtain the features as much as possible. "]]
