In 2020, due to the COVID 19 Pandemic, New York City implemented the lock down and social distance policy. Many Companies requires employees to work from home instead of going to office everyday. We want to analyze the pandemic's influence on New York City residents, specially for 1.6M Manhattan residents who use as part of their commute tools.

3.Ratings/comments- Is there any distribution patterns of rating scores in each neighborhood?  How do emotions of users change over time for their airbnb experience?
