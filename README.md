# EDAV Project: In-depth Market Research of Airbnb in NYC

**Updated**: 2020-12-17

**Authors**: Zhiyi Chen, Zhuo Zhuo

## Goals

For this project, we decided to focus our research on New York Cityâ€™s Airbnb data as it is one of the hottest cities for tourism. Since Airbnb is facing fierce competition from the hotel industry here, we believe that New York City can be a great case for us to analyze its business success. 


We will explore the following questions:

1. How do the distribution and occupancy of Airbnb's properties in the New York Metropolitan area change over the years? 
  
2.  What aspects influence the review score of an Airbnb property the most? 
  
3.  How does Covid-19 influence Airbnb businesses in New York City?



## Data

We choose the data compiled on Oct.24 in the New York Metropolitan area.

Listings: The listings data showing 74 attributes for each of the listings. Some attributes we will use in the project are Price (continuous), Longitude (continuous), Latitude (continuous), Listing_type (categorical), neighborhood (categorical), and ratings (continuous). 

The details of the data can be viewed[here](https://github.com/Joseph-Zhuo/airbnb_in_depth_research/tree/main/resource).
